            <b>Project Description:</b> Number Detector creates and uses a machine learning model to predict a hand written
            number. The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, and is retrained everytime the webpage loads.
            The model trains and runs locally, using javascript.

            <br />
            <ol>The <b>project design</b> is broken down into three parts:
                <li><b>(Model)</b> The CNN is a tensorflow sequential model. The model has six layers, with the final layer
                having ten output classes. The model is formed based on googles CNN walkthrough. </li>
                <li><b>(Training)</b> Upon the website loading the model will begin training. This is done using googles data
                class, based on MNIST. It takes about a minute for the model to train. Once training is complete
                sample data is displayed to show accuracy. </li>
                <li><b>(Predict)</b> The project uses HTML canvas to create a drawable pad. Once the drawing is complete
                the user can submit the drawing. The canvas drawing is converted to a tensorflow tensor, resized,
                color inverted, and reshaped. The model then makes a prediction based on the tensor, and results
                are displayed.</li>
            </ol>
